# AB-Testing-on-App-Booking-Page

This is a Flyber app that provides an on-demand flying-taxi service in New York City. As a data analytics
team, we’re dedicated to optimizing the user experience for the Flyber app to enhance the conversion rate
from every step of the user journey. The statistics showed the conversion rate of the app’s booking page
was comparatively lower than the competitors. Therefore, the goal of the test was to see how people engage
with the app booking page and which variations generated more bookings. We conducted AB Testing to examine the causal inference.
